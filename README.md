# Coding Quiz

I finally completed this coding quiz assignment, by far the most challenging assignment I've had to do yet. 

## Functionality
I set up everything besides the high score tracking, I was very unsure of how to do that. I submitted it how it was so that I could get feedback on it and know where to go from there. 

### Styling 
I added styling to the start button and it didn't work. I was wondering if the TA's could also take a look at that and tell me where I'm messing up.
